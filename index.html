You own a cat and you are looking for a solution to keep it while you are away? Cats are independent animals that can manage very well on their own. However, during a prolonged absence, many owners are looking for a solution to look after their cat. Indeed, even if our feline friends are autonomous, it is quite normal to have your cat looked after in order to ensure its well-being until your return.
